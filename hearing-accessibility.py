# This file would store the code for each of the hearing accessibility options.

# Digital Prototype Instructions:
# For the simulation only, click the space bar to return back to the game.

# Project Documentation:
# While this is being shown as a public repository due to simulation purposes, the intent is that using the research to show the needs that
# could be created as it's own project with further development as an extension or separate piece of software to give devlopers a foundation 
# into providing accesibility options especially for those of visual and hearing needs into any program at the start of developement
# instead of having to take large amounts of development time to develop something that might already be made somewhere else. That way, the 
# development can focus on creating more features and to hopefully improve development time speeds and to add more customizability and help.

# Once the file is on a computer screen, it would be able to be saved in your own project and could be edited at any time.
# For developers, the intent is that there would be an option to make it to where players can edit the software or not especially with the 
# concepts of modding but also with the thoughts of creating more solutions in a community-base to help in growing accessibility in programs but 
# especially with video games as a focus.
# For the players, it would help for also creating new features and improving further on accessibility to help people with assistance 
# beyond what has been provided.

# Any imports such as for AI models, additional assets for adding vision accessibility would go here.
# Examples would be an AI model that helps for adding closed captioning to what appears when running the game.
# User Interface imports would also be supported. For the simulation, it all is a placeholder as a single file.

# Listed below would be a function for each of the options that are used at the start of the software.
# The options that would be available no matter what are shown in the digital prototype based on previously completed user research would 
# be available initially in this file.

# Closed Captioning Code Placeholder

# Automizing Visual Cues Code Placeholder

# Haptic Feedback Code Placeholder

# User Interface Hearing Accessibility Menu Code Placeholder
